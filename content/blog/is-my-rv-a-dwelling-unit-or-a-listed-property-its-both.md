When you were buying your RV, your dealer told you it was a dwelling unit and you could write off your taxes and interest. But what if you mostly use your RV for transportation and barely sleep and eat in it? Well, in this case, your RV could also be a vehicle. 

In **[Shirley](https://www.leagle.com/decision/200422888aftcm1401197),** the Tax Court came up with a "primary function test." If a taxpayer has to get a hotel in the absence of an RV, then his/her RV qualifies as a lodging unit. If she/he has to get a car in the absence of an RV, then the RV should be classified as a vehicle. From the IRS standpoint, if the taxpayer spends more time lodging in the RV rather than driving, then the RV should be classified as a lodging facility. 

Inherently, the IRS tends to classify RVs as dwelling units. It's not good news for people who legitimately use their RVs for business purposes. This is because of Section 280A(a). In plain terms, that Section states that there should be no business deduction for a dwelling unit used as a residence. Your RV becomes a residence if you use it for personal needs for the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days rented. 

There was a **[court case,](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1764989.html)** where a couple was disallowed RV tax deductions because of the Section 280A rule. A California couple had an insurance brokerage business, where they were selling recreational vehicle policies. They would drive their RV to various rallies and set up a tent where they advertised their insurance services to potential clients. During their rally years, they generated significant business revenue and felt that they were entitled to write off their RVs as a business expense.

The IRS disallowed tax deductions, and the couple took the case to the Tax Court where they lost again. The Tax Court studied Code Sec. 280A(a), and claimed that even such innocent activity as watching TV constitutes personal use. The couple didn't provide 

 since the couple used RV for personal purposes for over 14 days during the year, Code Sec. 280A prohibited any tax deductions.

Code Sec. 280A(c) does contain several exceptions to the general disallowance rule. One of them is an exception where the taxpayer is allowed to allocate costs to a certain portion of the dwelling unit. But for the exception to apply, a portion of the RV must be exclusively used on a regular basis as the principal place of business or as a place to meet or deal with clients. Since the couple did not use any portion of their RV exclusively for business, the court disallowed all their deductions.

The moral of the story: no matter how much you drive your RV, it is still considered a dwelling unit. And if you want the IRS to allow your tax deductions, you need to remember the 14-day rule.

**There are a couple of other tax rules to consider.**

Since RV is a dwelling unit and a dwelling unit is real estate, we now need to brush up on **material vs passive participation rules**. All real estate activity is passive participation by default, unless you prove otherwise. In plain words this means that your tax deductions won’t be allowed in full and won’t be immediate. Passive activity losses are subject to income limitations and if income limitations exist, the losses are carried over to future years until the taxpayer finally disposes of the RV. Material participation has a better tax outcome but you need to prove your level of participation to the IRS.

To materially participate in an activity, the taxpayer must be involved in the operations of the activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis. One of the most used tests in making a determination as to whether a taxpayer **[materially participated](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/material-participation.html)**, is the 500 hours test, where a taxpayer has performed qualifying activities for the activity in question that exceed 500 hours. The taxpayer’s hours of participation need not be proven by contemporaneous daily time reports, logs, or similar documents. Rather, any reasonable means of proof may be sufficient. For example, a taxpayer can identify the services he has performed, and the approximate number of hours spent performing those services based on appointment books, calendars, or narrative summaries.

If your RV operation is handled via a management company (to perform maintenance, compliance with local laws, finding renters), then it may be difficult to prove that you performed enough services to meet the material participation tests.

**And the last tax rule that you may need to consider**. Surprise, Surprise! Apart from being a dwelling unit, your RV is also considered a** [listed property](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/listed-property/)**. This means that you need to know basic depreciation rules.

There are three categories of listed property:

(1)   passenger automobiles;

(2)   any other property used as a means of transportation; and

(3)    property of a type that (a) is generally used for purposes of entertainment, recreation, or amusement, and (b) is not used exclusively at the taxpayer’s regular business establishment or in connection with the taxpayer’s principal trade or business

RVs are listed property that fall within category two above. However, many RVs also fall within the third category. If the RV is considered a business asset, the RV owner is afforded the ability to depreciate the asset over its useful life. Additionally, the taxpayer would be permitted to deduct expenses associated with operating the RV for its business purpose. Under the listed property provisions, the asset must be used more than 50% for its business purpose, otherwise, the listed property limitations apply.

To summarize this article, before deciding to write off your RV, you need to make sure you didn’t break the 14- day rule. If everything looks good, you need to decide whether your involvement in the RV business is material or passive in nature. And after you decide on this, you can start reading up on depreciation rules for listed property.

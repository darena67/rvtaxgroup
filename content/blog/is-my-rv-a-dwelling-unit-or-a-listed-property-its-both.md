When you were buying your RV, your dealer told you it was a dwelling unit and you could write off your taxes and interest. But what if you mostly use your RV for transportation and barely sleep and eat in it? Well, in this case, your RV could also be a vehicle. 

In **[Shirley](https://www.leagle.com/decision/200422888aftcm1401197),** the Tax Court came up with a "primary function test." If a taxpayer has to get a hotel in the absence of an RV, then his/her RV qualifies as a lodging unit. If she/he has to get a car in the absence of an RV, then the RV should be classified as a vehicle. From the IRS standpoint, if the taxpayer spends more time lodging in the RV rather than driving, then the RV should be classified as a lodging facility. 

Inherently, the IRS tends to classify RVs as dwelling units. It's not good news for people who legitimately use their RVs for business purposes. This is because of Section 280A. In plain terms, that Section states that there should be no business deduction for a dwelling unit used as a personal residence. The only time when you can get some write-off is when you use a part of your residency **exclusively** for businesses. Your RV becomes a residence if you use it for personal needs for the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days rented. 

There was a **[court case,](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1764989.html)** where a couple was disallowed RV tax deductions because of the Section 280A rule. A California couple had an insurance brokerage business, where they were selling recreational vehicle policies. They would drive their RV to various rallies and set up a tent where they advertised their insurance services to potential clients. During their rally years, they generated significant business revenue and felt that they were entitled to write off their RVs as a business expense.

The IRS disallowed tax deductions, and the couple took the case to the Tax Court where they lost again. The Tax Court studied Code Sec. 280A, and claimed that even such an innocent activity as watching TV constitutes personal use. The couple used the RV personally for more than 14 days and that made their RV a personal residence.  The court stated that the couple did not use any portion of their residence exclusively for business as it is required in Section 280A(c). Therefore, no deduction for the expenses allocated to its business use was allowed.

My theory is that the couple could have avoided such a harsh outcome if they were able to prove that they used the RV personally than 14 days. Or, if they pointed the Tax Court to 280A(f)(4), which states that "Nothing in this section shall be construed to disallow any deduction allowable under section **[162(a)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162)**. Section 162(a)2 allows deduction of traveling expenses while away from home on business.

**But wait, if Section 280A allows travelling expenses, then may be some of the RV** 

**And the last tax rule that you may need to consider**. Surprise, Surprise! Apart from being a dwelling unit, your RV is also considered a** [listed property](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/listed-property/)**. This means that you need to know basic depreciation rules.

There are three categories of listed property:

(1)   passenger automobiles;

(2)   any other property used as a means of transportation; and

(3)    property of a type that (a) is generally used for purposes of entertainment, recreation, or amusement, and (b) is not used exclusively at the taxpayer’s regular business establishment or in connection with the taxpayer’s principal trade or business

RVs are listed property that fall within category two above. However, many RVs also fall within the third category. If the RV is considered a business asset, the RV owner is afforded the ability to depreciate the asset over its useful life. Additionally, the taxpayer would be permitted to deduct expenses associated with operating the RV for its business purpose. Under the listed property provisions, the asset must be used more than 50% for its business purpose, otherwise, the listed property limitations apply.

To summarize this article, before deciding to write off your RV, you need to make sure you didn’t break the 14- day rule. If everything looks good, you need to decide whether your involvement in the RV business is material or passive in nature. And after you decide on this, you can start reading up on depreciation rules for listed property.

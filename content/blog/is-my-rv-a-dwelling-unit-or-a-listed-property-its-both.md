When you were buying your RV, your dealer told you it was a dwelling unit and you could write off your taxes and interest. But what if you mostly use your RV for transportation and barely sleep and eat in it? Well, in this case, your RV could also be a vehicle. 

In **[Shirley](https://www.leagle.com/decision/200422888aftcm1401197),** the Tax Court came up with a "primary function test." If a taxpayer has to get a hotel in the absence of an RV, then his/her RV qualifies as a lodging unit. If she/he has to get a car in the absence of an RV, then the RV should be classified as a vehicle. From the IRS standpoint, if the taxpayer spends more time lodging in the RV rather than driving, then the RV should be classified as a lodging facility. 

Inherently, the IRS tends to classify RVs as dwelling units. It's not good news for people who legitimately use their RVs for business purposes. This is because of Section 280A. In plain terms, that Section states that there should be no business deduction for a dwelling unit used as a personal residence. The only time when you can get some write-off is when you use a part of your residency **exclusively** for businesses. Your RV becomes a residence if you use it for personal needs for the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days rented. 

There was a **[court case,](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1764989.html)** where a couple was disallowed RV tax deductions because of the Section 280A rule. A California couple had an insurance brokerage business, where they were selling recreational vehicle policies. They would drive their RV to various rallies and set up a tent where they advertised their insurance services to potential clients. During their rally years, they generated significant business revenue and felt that they were entitled to write off their RVs as a business expense.

The IRS disallowed tax deductions, and the couple took the case to the Tax Court where they lost again. The Tax Court studied Code Sec. 280A, and claimed that even such an innocent activity as watching TV constitutes personal use. The couple used the RV personally for more than 14 days and that made their RV a personal residence.  The court stated that the couple did not use any portion of their residence exclusively for business as it is required in Section 280A(c). Therefore, no deduction for the expenses allocated to its business use was allowed.

My theory is that the couple could have avoided such a harsh outcome if they were able to prove that they used the RV personally than 14 days. Or, if they pointed the Tax Court to 280A(f)(4), which states that "Nothing in this section shall be construed to disallow any deduction allowable under section **[162(a)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/162)**. Section 162(a)2 allows deduction of traveling expenses while away from home on business.

**Wait, Section 280A(f)(4) allows travel expenses?**

You are correct. When you are in travel status,  you can deduct 100 percent of the costs of getting to and from your business destination when the primary purpose of your trip is business.  This means that you should be able to deduct gas, and take depreciation on your RV as a hotel.

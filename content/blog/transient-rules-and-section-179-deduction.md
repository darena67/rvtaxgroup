Transient rules are important because they allow taking a big tax deduction for your RV in the year it was purchased. Transient Rules are applied in two situations: 1. You use your RV for business trips. 2. You rent out your RV to other people on such sites as Outdoorsy or RVshare.

Under the transient rule, your RV can qualify for Section 179 expensing if your use is for stays on a transient basis. Your motor home is used on a transient basis when you use it like a motel at a single location for less** [than 30 days](https://bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Reg_1_48-1h2ii.pdf)**. For example, when traveling for business, you stay at 14 locations and never stay at a single location for 30 days or more.  Or, when you rent out your RV out and the average length of your customer's stay is less than 30 days.

In looking at your days for the year, you look to days of use only. Days of nonuse do not count. For example, the motor home sits in your driveway unused for 75 days in a row. You do not consider the 75 days of nonuse in your tax calculations.

**Suggestions:**
Lawmakers made the business and personal mileage ratio the official basis for vehicle deductions. Thus, make sure that you first have a mileage log on your business motor home. Your mileage log substantiates your business use. In all likelihood, you will use mileage to establish your percentage of business use of the motor home. So, if your mileage log is 100% business, you will be able to take full Section 179 deduction.

Second, make sure to establish that the motor home is used on a transient basis for the year. Your most audit proof assertion of transient use is on the basis of days of use. This means that you need a record of each night's stay that shows where you were and why you were there. To make sure you have your motor home business use wired for deductions, make this one additional note not required by the travel rules: For each night of business use, make a note about whether it is a transient or a non-transient night. 

**Restrictions on Section 179**:
Section 179 expense is available for any new used or new property that you purchase for business purposes during the tax year. You can’t use it on gifted, inherited, or leased property. Nor you may use it if you purchase your property from a relative or any organization that you control. Businesses that use the property may elect to use Section 179 only if the property is used for more than half of the time. Therefore, you will have to reduce the deduction by the percentage of personal use. If in consequent years, the business use percentage drops to 50% or less, you will have to recapture the section 179 deduction by recognizing it as ordinary income. Therefore, be mindful when taking section 179 expense, especially if you think you will be using your RV for personal purposes in future years. 

**Important Rules:** 
**Avoid ANY personal use when renting to transients**.                                                                                                 The courts have held that one day of personal use will turn your hotel rental activity into a residential rental activity under vacation home rules. Residential rental triggers the recapture of your **[Section 179 deduction](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/TC_Memo_2006-33.pdf).** 

Follow these steps to avoid **[personal use:](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Prop_Reg_1_280A-1e.pdf)**

1. Do not use the motorhome yourself
2. Do not let your relatives use it
3. Do not allow any person to rent it for less than fair rental
4. Do not swap your RV for other arrangements

**Be mindful of vacation home rules when using your RV as business lodging.**
If the taxpayer uses his/her RV for personal needs for the greater of 14 days or 10% of total days rented, the IRS considers the motor home a personal residence. The taxpayer cannot deduct expenses (Including Section 179 deduction) “with respect to the use of a dwelling unit which is used by the taxpayer during the taxable year as a residence”. In[ **a famous case**](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/TC_Memo_2014-160.pdf)**,** the tax court ruled that the taxpayer's motor home was a personal residence and disallowed all expenses. Therefore, it is very important that you track your personal days and make sure that you do not use your RV personally for more than 14 days.

Transient rules allow the taxpayer to benefit from Section 179 deduction. However, Section 179 has many issues: You may face a recapture and pay taxes in upcoming years. Or the IRS may get nitpicky and disallow the section 179 deduction at all based on little-known court cases. It is our opinion that if you want to be IRS Audit Safe, you should avoid taking the Section 179 deduction at all and stick with traditional MACRs.

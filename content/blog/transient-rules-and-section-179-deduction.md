There is a *possibility* to write off your RV in the year you purchase it by applying Section 179 rules. You can use Section 179 when you treat your RV as a lodging unit or a vehicle. It is much easier to apply Section 179 to the RV classified as a vehicle. However, generally, the IRS looks at the RV as a lodging unit. If you want that Section 179 deduction, you have to comply with what the IRS says about lodging units. This blog discusses section 179 rules ONLY in the context of the RV being a lodging unit.

To use Section 179 with a lodging unit, you need to comply with the transient rule. The lodging unit is used on a transient basis when you use it as a hotel at a single location for less **[than 30 days](https://bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Reg_1_48-1h2ii.pdf)**. There was **[a court case,](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2648147509062590340&q=Shirley+v.+Comm%27r,+2004+T.C.+Memo.+188&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&as_vis=1)** where the taxpayer, who owned a fleet of rental RVs was allowed to take the Section 179 deduction because the court ruled that his rental RVs were lodging units used by transients. 

This court ruling can be applied to two situations: 1. You use your RV for business trips 2. You rent out your RV to other people on such sites as Outdoorsy or RVshare. For example, when traveling for business, you stay at 14 locations and never stay at a single location for 30 days or more.  Or, when you rent out your RV out and the average length of your customer's stay is less than 30 days.

In looking at your days for the year, you look to days of use only. Days of nonuse do not count. For example, the motor home sits in your driveway unused for 75 days in a row. You do not consider the 75 days of nonuse in your tax calculations.

**Suggestions:**

Lawmakers made the business and personal mileage ratio the official basis for vehicle deductions. Thus, make sure that you first have a mileage log on your business motor home. Your mileage log substantiates your business use. In all likelihood, you will use mileage to establish your percentage of business use of the motor home. So, if your mileage log is 100% business, you will be able to take full Section 179 deduction.

Second, when using your RV for business lodging, make sure to establish that the motor home is used on a transient basis for the year. Your most audit proof assertion of transient use is on the basis of days of use. This means that you need a record of each night's stay that shows where you were and why you were there. To make sure you have your motor home business use wired for deductions, make this one additional note not required by the travel rules: For each night of business use, make a note about whether it is a transient or a non-transient night. 

**Restrictions on Section 179**:

Section 179 expense is available for any new used or new property that you purchase for business purposes during the tax year. You canâ€™t use it on gifted, inherited, or leased property. Nor you may use it if you purchase your property from a relative or any organization that you control. Under ordinary circumstances, businesses can reduce Section 179 deduction by the percentage of personal use. However, you can't do it in the RV situation. This is because if you want to qualify for the Section 179 expense, your RV has to be in transient status, which requires 0% personal use. 

**Important Rules:** 
**Avoid ANY personal use when renting to transients**.                                                                                                 The courts have held that one day of personal use will turn your hotel rental activity into a residential rental activity under vacation home rules. Residential rental triggers the recapture of your **[Section 179 deduction](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/TC_Memo_2006-33.pdf).** 

Follow these steps to avoid **[personal use:](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Prop_Reg_1_280A-1e.pdf)**

1. Do not use the motorhome for things like watching TV and hosting parties.
2. Do not let your relatives use it.
3. Do not allow any person to rent it for less than fair rental.
4. Do not swap your RV for other arrangements.



Transient rules may allow you to benefit from Section 179 deduction. However, Section 179 has many issues: You may face a recapture and pay taxes in the next year. Or the IRS may get nitpicky and disallow the section 179 deduction because they feel that you didn't comply with the transient rules and your RV is mere a lodging unit. It is our opinion that if you want to be IRS audit safe, you should avoid taking the Section 179 deduction at all and stick with traditional MACRs.

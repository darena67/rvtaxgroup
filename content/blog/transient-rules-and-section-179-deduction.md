There is a *possibility* to write off your RV in the year you purchase it by applying Section 179 rules. You can use Section 179 when you treat your RV as a lodging unit or a vehicle. 

How do you determine if your RV is a residence or a vehicle? In **[Shirley](https://www.leagle.com/decision/200422888aftcm1401197),** the tax court battled with this question and finally narrowed it down to the "primary function test." If one has to pay for the hotel in the absence of an RV, then his/her RV qualifies as a lodging unit. If one has to get a car in the absence of an RV, then the RV should be classified as a vehicle. But what if you have to get both a hotel and a car? The court left this question unanswered. The IRS argues, that if the taxpayer spends more time lodging in the RV rather than driving, then the RV should be classiffied as a lodging facility.

It is much easier to apply Section 179 to the RV classified as a vehicle because  vehicles are allowed to take Section 179 expense. However, it gets more complicated if your RV is considered a lodging unit.  Lodging units classified as personal residences are not allowed to apply Section 179 with one exception.

This exception is called a transient rule. A lodging unit is used on a transient basis when one uses the unit as a hotel at a single location for less **[than 30 days](https://bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Reg_1_48-1h2ii.pdf)**. For example, you post your RV on several rental sites and all of your rentals last less than 30 days. If this happens, in the eyes of the IRS your RV becomes a hotel. And hotels are allowed to take section 179 Deduction. However, even one day of personal use may kick you out of the hotel status and your deduction will be disallowed.

You can also use your RV as a "take it with you business lodging facility" and as long as you don't stay at the same place for 30 days, you can claim that you used your RV as a hotel. However, this will only work if a) your RV is not your**[ tax home](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/general/what-is-a-tax-home/L27AVL2QM)** b) you don't use your RV for personal purposes. And this approach is risky.  Previously, the IRS claimed that "a taxpayer, who uses a motor home as lodging while away from home retains the ownership of motorhome and is in no way a transient to respect with that motor home". 

If you use your RV mostly for travel, then your RV is a vehicle and section 179 is allowed. However, make sure to document your business and personal miles. Lawmakers make the business / personal mileage ratio the official business for vehicle deductions. No mileage records mean no business deductions.

**Suggestions:**

In looking at your days for the year, you look to days of use only. Days of nonuse do not count. For example, the motor home sits in your driveway unused for 75 days in a row. You do not consider the 75 days of nonuse in your tax calculations.

Your mileage log substantiates your business use. In all likelihood, you will use mileage to establish your percentage of business use of the motor home. So, if your mileage log is 100% business, you will be able to take full Section 179 deduction.

Second, if you decide to use your RV as "take it with me business lodging", make sure to establish that the motor home is used on a transient basis for the year. Your most audit-proof assertion of transient use is on the basis of days of use. This means that you need a record of each night's stay that shows where you were and why you were there. To make sure you have your motor home business use wired for deductions, make this one additional note not required by the travel rules: For each night of business use, make a note about whether it is a transient or a non-transient night. 

**Restrictions on Section 179**:

Section 179 expense is available for any new used or new property that you purchase for business purposes during the tax year. You canâ€™t use it on gifted, inherited, or leased property. Nor you may use it if you purchase your property from a relative or any organization that you control. Under ordinary circumstances, businesses can reduce Section 179 deduction by the percentage of personal use. However, you can't do this when you claim that your RV was used on a transient basis. This is because if you want to qualify for the Section 179 expense, your RV has to be in transient status, which requires 0% personal use. 

**Important Rules:** 


**Avoid ANY personal use when renting to transients**.                                                                                                 The courts have held that one day of personal use will turn your hotel rental activity into a residential rental activity under vacation home rules. Residential rental triggers the recapture of your **[Section 179 deduction](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/TC_Memo_2006-33.pdf).** 

Follow these steps to avoid **[personal use:](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/Prop_Reg_1_280A-1e.pdf)**

1. Do not use the motorhome for things like watching TV and hosting parties.
2. Do not let your relatives use it.
3. Do not allow any person to rent it for less than fair rental.
4. Do not swap your RV for other arrangements.

Transient rules may allow you to benefit from Section 179 deduction. However, Section 179 has many issues: You may face a recapture and pay taxes in the next year. Or the IRS may get nitpicky and disallow the section 179 deduction because they feel that you didn't comply with the transient rules and your RV is mere a lodging unit. It is our opinion that if you want to be IRS audit safe, you should avoid taking the Section 179 deduction at all and stick with traditional MACRs.

I bet you came here from an RV forum, where someone said something about the home office deduction for your RV. You are thinking of taking the deduction, but you need to know more to understand how it works. Well, you came to the right place.

Here is a starting point for your tax research. The IRS classifies the RV as a dwelling unit and all dwelling units are subject to Section 280A rules. The main idea of this section is that you can’t deduct business expenses for a residential property unless the space in your home qualifies for the home office exception.

The main rule of the home office deduction is exclusivity. There were two cases where the tax court disallowed BUOH deductions for RVs because the exclusivity rule was not met. In **J[acksons](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9816944377472901469&q=dellward+judith+jackson&hl=en&as_sdt=2006)**, the couple didn’t outline the square footage of their home office and claimed the whole RV as a business asset. Jacksons didn’t win because the exclusivity test was not met. The same happened to the **[Dunfords.](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/TC_Memo_2013-189.pdf)** The couple claimed that the RV countertop was used as a business space. However, they didn’t provide square footage percentage and the court could not figure out the correct tax deduction. In addition, the court ruled: “It is implausible to suggest that, in the cramped quarters of a motor home, an unclosed area like the countertop would somehow be exclusively reserved to business activity”.

Does that mean that your dream to take a home office deduction is officially over? Well, if you are feeling adventurous, here is a tax **[court case](https://www.bradfordtaxinstitute.com/Endnotes/TC_Memo_1991-592.pdf')** with the opposite outcome. In this case, Albert Mills defended his business use of home deduction despite living in a 422 square foot apartment. He kept his tools and supplies in a small storage area that he didn’t use for any other purposes and the court allowed home office deduction for this specific area.

How can you apply the Mills case to your RV situation?

The IRS recognized that the exclusive use rule can be difficult for owners of small homes and they came up with what we call the "de minimis” personal use. This means that you can set up your office in an area that you must walkthrough for personal reasons. For example, you can deduct the home office even though you have to pass through it to get to the bathroom. Think of the de-minimus rule as a walk-through rule. If you simply pass through the area, you can use it for the office space. If you use this area to eat or watch TV, then you cannot deduct it.

Most likely, the Dundorfs also used the countertop personal activities such as eating and socializing. But what if you have a storage cabinet where you store all of your business files and supplies. You cannot use it for any other purposes. You cannot eat on it. You can not sit on it. It just stands there.

If you pull a table to it and do your work there, then hypothetically you can deduct the business use of space taken by the cabinet. The cabinet is exclusively used for your business. And you are allowed to pass through the area due because of the “de-minimus” rules.

\
This is only hypothetical speculation, which was not tried out in tax court and may or may not work. You will have significantly more chances of winning the IRS audit, if you have some closed-off area around the cabinet. Or better, a separate room. In addition, the home office deduction for such a small business space may not even be worth your time. But I hope you got a good understanding of how the business home deduction works and you can now finally decide if it works for your RV situation.

      Hi there!


      My name is Daria. I am originally from Russia, but I have lived in the US for so long that I am starting to forget my native language. Like most Russians you meet, I am pretty straightforward and have a dry sense of humor (although my teenage son insists I have none).


      My mom was an accountant. When it was time for me to go to school, I could not come up with a better idea than becoming one. These days I am a California CPA and an Enrolled Agent. Before starting on my own, I worked for several CPA firms where I primarily focused on the taxation of small businesses, real estate entities, and high-net-worth individuals.


      RV taxation is very specialized. In hopes to help others, I started my [**blog** ](https://rvtaxgroup.com/blog/)on the topic. I hope it is useful and easy to read. If you still need help, please email me at daria@rvtaxgroup.com

faqs:
  - question: Do you charge by the hour?
    answer: We avoid billing by the hour whenever it’s possible. It creates
      ambiguity and makes you worry about your upcoming CPA bill. The only time
      we are billing by the hour is when we cannot reasonably estimate our time
      spend on a specific non-recurring project.
  - answer: " We will be more than happy to meet you in person if you are in San
      Diego area. If not, we try to set up Zoom meetings for all of our new
      customers. Also, California CPAs can be verified on the CBA website. You
      are welcome to look us up! We are in compliance. "
    question: Can I meet you in person? Afterall, you have my personal information!
  - question: How do you deliver sensitive information to clients?
    answer: We are paperless and virtual. We utilize a secure client portal to
      exchange and deliver private information. Client documents are
      encrypted  and stored on a secure server with two-factor authentication.
  - question: Do you require a retainer?
    answer: "We ask our new clients to pay upfront. "
